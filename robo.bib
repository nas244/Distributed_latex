Securing a wireless connection is essential since an eavesdropper might interrupt a connection to collect data illegitimately, or interfere with the transmission by adding misleading data, eliminating critical information, or altering transmitted messages. With the widespread deployment of mobile networks, wireless communications are increasingly important to both ordinary users and researchers. Securing a wireless connection is essential since an eavesdropper might interrupt a connection to collect data, or interfere with the transmission. Saad Al-Azzam, Ahmad Sharieh and Azzam Sleit of the University of Jordan and Nedaa Al-Azzam of Al-Dammam University propose an algorithm that secures both the message itself by employing a multi-level encryption technique and secures the transmission by broadcasting it over multiple interfaces."

That claim is,  however, rather less frequently supported by empirical or  theoretical analysis. But what do we mean by a 'robust'  swarm? How would we measure the robustness or â€“ to put it  another way â€“ fault-tolerance of a robotic swarm? These  questions are not just of academic interest. If swarm  robotics is to make the transition from the laboratory to  real-world engineering implementation, we would need to be  able to address these questions in a way that would satisfy  the needs of the world of safety certification. This paper  explores fault-tolerance in robot swarms through Failure  Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and reliability modelling.  The work of this paper is illustrated by a case study of a  wireless connected robot swarm, employing both simulation  and real-robot laboratory experiments.},
